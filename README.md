## 📚 Project Description
Our project is a program designed to automatically generate a comprehensive summary of a patient's
sequence of scans displayed onto a web app. This program involves collecting lesion data and presenting it clearly. 
We utilize tables, textual summaries, and graphic displays to showcase lesion patterns over time. 
This allows radiologists to gather more precise information in a shorter time frame.

The summary format will be interactive, allowing radiologists to customize the displayed information. In addition, 
we generate the summary in a PDF form to support printable summary. 
This design ensures no crucial details are omitted while avoiding overwhelming with extraneous information.


## ⚡ Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### 🧱 Prerequisites
Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push:

1. Verify that you have ITK-snap app installed on your PC and that it is in the system PATH
