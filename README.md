## 📚 Project Description
Our project is a program designed to automatically generate a comprehensive summary of a patient's
sequence of scans. This program involves collecting lesion data and presenting it clearly. 
We utilize tables, textual summaries, and graphic displays to showcase lesion patterns over time. 
This allows radiologists to gather more precise information in a shorter time frame.

The summary format will be interactive, allowing radiologists to customize the displayed information. In addition, 
we generate the summary in a PDF form to support printable summary. 
This design ensures no crucial details are omitted while avoiding overwhelming with extraneous information.


## ⚡ Getting Started
